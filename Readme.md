This is the Prophet tool mentioned on places on **[www.cs.miami.edu](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/ATPSystems/Prophet/)** , and in this  research paper by Aman Kakkad (addys06@gmail.com) who is a master's student at University of Miami [Machine Learning for Automated Theorem Proving](http://scholarlyrepository.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1222&context=oa_theses).

Mentions of this tools can also be found in [Lemma Management Techniques for Automated Theorem Proving](http://www.cs.miami.edu/home/geoff/Papers/Conference/2005_ZS05_IWIL-5-87-94.pdf), and [Machine Learning for Automated Reasoning](http://www.cs.miami.edu/home/geoff/ResearchProjects/ForStudents/MLAR.pdf).


I had greate trouble in finding this tool, therefore I am uploading this so that it can help others. The original link for this tool is [ServiceTools](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/ServiceTools.tgz). It is listed on [this](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/) web page.

Hope it helps!
